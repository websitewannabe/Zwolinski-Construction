          The Internet constitutes the largest resource supporting freedom of
          information today for the user community in general and for users with
          disabilities in particular. For that reason we place emphasis on
          granting equal service to people with disabilities who use information
          displayed on the website, and on improving their browsing experience.
          We seek to ensure that our digital services will be accessible to
          people with disabilities, and accordingly, we have invested in the
          website's ease of use for people with disabilities, and continue to
          improve our web pages as needed.

            Despite our efforts to apply accessibility to browsing on every

            received accessibility or are not suitable for any available
            accessibility solution.

            to the full extent possible, guided by our belief, and by our moral

          <p className="mb-4">
            The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standard defines

            It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level
            AAA. "Fully conforms" means that the content meets all of the WCAG
            requirements at the specified Level without exceptions. We strive to
