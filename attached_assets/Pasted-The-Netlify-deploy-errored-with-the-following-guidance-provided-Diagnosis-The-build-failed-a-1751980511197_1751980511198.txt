The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed at the stage of installing dependencies due to an `EJSONPARSE` error in the `package.json` file. The error message indicates a syntax issue in the JSON structure of the `package.json`.

**Solution:**
1. Verify the `package.json` in the repository to identify and correct the syntax error at position 199 in the file.
2. Ensure that all JSON objects have the correct structure with commas separating key-value pairs where necessary.
3. Once the issue is fixed, commit the changes to the repository and trigger a new build to ensure successful dependency installation.
